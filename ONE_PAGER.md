# Backr: The Future of Creator Monetization

## 🚨 The Problem
The creator economy is broken. Platforms like Patreon, Twitch, and YouTube:
1.  **Extract Value:** Charge high fees (8-30%).
2.  **Control Data:** Creators don't own their audience or email lists.
3.  **Censor Content:** Arbitrary bans and de-platforming destroy livelihoods.
4.  **Delay Payments:** Funds are held for 30+ days.

## 💡 The Solution: Backr
Backr is a decentralized membership platform built on the **Mantle Network**. It gives power back to creators through smart contracts.

### Key Value Props
*   **Ownership:** Creators deploy their own independent smart contracts.
*   **Direct Payments:** 95% of revenue goes instantly to the creator's wallet.
*   **Censorship Resistance:** Memberships live on the blockchain, not our servers.
*   **Low Fees:** Flat 5% platform fee. No monthly subscriptions.

## 💰 Business Model
We succeed only when our creators succeed.
*   **Fee:** 5% protocol fee on all transactions.
*   **Revenue Stream:** Fee is collected automatically via smart contract at the time of withdrawal.
*   **Treasury:** Funds are directed to a DAO-controlled treasury for platform development.
