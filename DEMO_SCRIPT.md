# Demo Video Script (3-5 Minutes)

**Goal:** Showcase the entire user flow: Landing Page -> Connect Wallet -> Creator Dashboard -> Public Profile -> Subscription.

## Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
*   **Screen:** Show the Landing Page (`/`).
*   **Action:** Scroll down slowly through the sections (Hero, How it Works, Comparison).
*   **Script:**
    > "Hi, I'm [Your Name] and this is **Backr**, the next-generation membership platform built on the Mantle Network.
    > The creator economy is broken—high fees, delayed payouts, and lack of ownership.
    > Backr solves this by letting creators deploy their own smart contracts. We take a flat 5% fee, and payments are instant."

## Scene 2: Connect & Dashboard (0:30 - 1:30)
*   **Action:** Click "Connect Wallet". Sign the request in MetaMask.
*   **Action:** Click "For Creators" or "Go to Studio".
*   **Screen:** Dashboard Home.
*   **Script:**
    > "Once I connect my wallet, I enter the Creator Studio.
    > Here, I can see my total revenue, active members, and recent activity. All this data is pulled directly from the blockchain and Supabase."
*   **Action:** Click "Settings" tab.
*   **Script:**
    > "In Settings, I can deploy my own Membership Contract. This is a real smart contract on Mantle that *I* own.
    > I can also customize my public profile."

## Scene 3: Content & Tiers (1:30 - 2:30)
*   **Action:** Click "Community" -> "Manage Tiers".
*   **Script:**
    > "I can create different membership tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold—and set the price in MNT.
    > I can also post exclusive content."
*   **Action:** Go to "New Post", type a title like "Exclusive Update", select "Silver Tier & Up", and hit Publish.
*   **Script:**
    > "When I publish a post, it's token-gated. Only users with a valid subscription on the blockchain can read it."

## Scene 4: The Supporter Experience (2:30 - 3:30)
*   **Action:** Open an Incognito window (or switch wallets) to act as a fan.
*   **Action:** Go to your Public Profile (`/yourusername`).
*   **Script:**
    > "Now, looking at it as a fan. I see the 'Premium' profile layout.
    > I can see the locked posts."
*   **Action:** Click "Join" on a Tier. Approve transaction in MetaMask.
*   **Script:**
    > "I'll subscribe to the Silver tier. The transaction happens on Mantle Network—fast and cheap."
*   **Action:** Wait for confetti/success toast.
*   **Script:**
    > "And just like that, I'm a member. The funds went directly to the creator's wallet, minus the 5% platform fee."

## Scene 5: Conclusion (3:30 - 4:00)
*   **Screen:** Back to Landing Page or Dashboard.
*   **Script:**
    > "That's Backr. We're empowering creators to own their business.
    > Built on Mantle. Live now. Thanks for watching."
