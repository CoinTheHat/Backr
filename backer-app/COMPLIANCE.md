# Compliance Declaration

**Project Name:** Backr
**Date:** January 14, 2026

## Regulatory Assessment

### 1. Asset Nature
Backr utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate **Utililty Memberships**. The smart contracts deployed by creators issue non-transferable (or transferable, depending on configuration) access rights to specific content and communities.

*   **NOT A Security:** The memberships do not represent equity, profit-sharing, or ownership in the platform itself. They are purely utility-based access tokens.
*   **Utility Token:** The primary function is to grant access to goods (content) and services (community interaction).

### 2. Custody
Backr is a **Non-Custodial** platform.
*   We do not hold user funds.
*   We do not hold private keys.
*   All transactions are executed directly between the Subscriber and the Creator's Smart Contract.
*   The 5% platform fee is programmatically routed to the treasury address without intermediaries.

### 3. KYC/AML
As a decentralized frontend interface for smart contracts:
*   Users connect via self-custodial wallets (MetaMask, etc.).
*   We do not collect personal identification documents.
*   We adhere to the sanctions lists applicable to the jurisdiction of operation by blocking interaction from restricted regions at the frontend level if required.

### 4. Risk Disclosure
Users are informed that:
*   Smart contracts may contain bugs despite testing.
*   Crypto asset values can fluctuate.
*   They are responsible for their own private key management.
