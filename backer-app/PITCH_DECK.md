# Backr - Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Backr**
**The On-Chain Membership Platform for the Creator Economy**
*Build community. Get paid instantly. Own your audience.*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Creators are rented, not owned.**

*   **Platform Risk:** Web2 platforms (Patreon, YouTube, Gumroad) can de-platform creators or change algorithms overnight.
*   **High Fees:** Middlemen take 10-30% of revenue + payment processing fees.
*   **Delayed Payouts:** Creators wait 30-60 days to receive their earnings.
*   **Global Friction:** International payments are difficult, excluding millions of potential supporters and creators.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Backr: Patreon on Mantle.**

A decentralized membership platform where creators own their relationship with their audience.

*   **Censorship Resistant:** Content and subscriptions live on-chain.
*   **Instant Payouts:** Revenue streams directly to the creator's wallet.
*   **Low Fees:** Only 5% platform fee (vs. industry standard 8-12%).
*   **Global Payments:** Accept payments from anyone in the world via USDC/MNT, with near-zero gas fees.

---

## Slide 4: How It Works
**Simple for Creators, Seamless for Fans.**

1.  **Create Profile:** Connect wallet, set up profile, and define membership tiers.
2.  **Deploy Contract:** Each creator deploys their own "Subscription Contract" (Factory pattern).
3.  **Publish Content:** Post exclusive updates, images, and videos gated by membership tiers.
4.  **Get Backed:** Fans subscribe on-chain to unlock content.

## Slide 5: The Product
**A Premium, Web3-Native Experience.**

*   **Creator Studio:** Rich text editor, media support, and tier management.
*   **Discovery:** Explore page with categories (Art, Gaming, Tech) and hashtags.
*   **Analytics:** Real-time dashboard for earnings, subscribers, and retention.
*   **Token Gating:** content is automatically encrypted/hidden for non-subscribers.

---

## Slide 6: Market Opportunity
**The Creator Economy is Booming.**

*   **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** $250 Billion+ Creator Economy.
*   **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** Web3 Creators & Crypto-native communities.
*   **Growth:** Transitioning from "Rent" (Web2) to "Own" (Web3) is the next macro trend.

---

## Slide 7: Business Model
**Aligned Incentives.**

*   **Revenue Model:** 5% Platform Fee on all subscription withdrawals.
*   **No Upfront Cost:** Free to start. We only make money when creators make money.
*   **Scalability:** Smart contracts handle the heavy lifting of payments and access control, keeping operational costs low.

---

## Slide 8: Go-to-Market Strategy
**Phase 1: Crypto-Native Creators**
*   Targeting NFT artists, Web3 educators, and DAO contributors who already value decentralization.

**Phase 2: Global Reach**
*   Onboarding creators from high-inflation regions (LATAM, Turkey, SE Asia) where stablecoin income is vital.

**Phase 3: Mainstream**
*   Introducing fiat on-ramps to abstract away the "crypto" layer for regular fans.
